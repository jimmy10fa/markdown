The code will be consisting of two variebles and a random math method.

## Java code
package jameel;

public class jameelfatani {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub                               // Jameel Fatani
		
		// Using the Mathrandom, multiplying it with the alphabet character which is 26
		
		        int A = (int) (65 + Math.random() * 26);
		        
		        // Declearing the characters with is "char"
		        char B = (char) A; {
		                System.out.print( B );
		                
		                
		                
		                
		   }      
	}
}


## Console output
Q

## Command promt output
int A = (int) (65 + Math.random() * 26);

char B = (char) A; {
		                System.out.print( B );}


## Conclusion
Math random method is not only for numbers,however; it is based on the asignment in alphabits. We had to maintain a method which is **char**.
